# TicTacToe-MVC
This project was created to practice a software architectural pattern Model–View–Controller (MVC)

There are two different views implemented for this project (Window and Console). To check them both the only thing you need is to change the view in the TicTacToeGame class of package com.enfocat.tictactoe.

Also I tried to use Monte Carlo simulations in decision making in picking the best moves for computer.

The project was created with
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers,
Version: Neon.2 Release (4.6.2)
